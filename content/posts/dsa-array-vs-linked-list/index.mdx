# Linked List vs. Arrays

## Memory Allocation

- Arrays: takes all space even if it doesn't contain any element yet
- Linked List: only takes the portion of the space as it uses

## Insertion and Deletion

- Linked List: constant time O(1) for deleting at head.
- Array: O(n) time because you have to traverse and shift the array elements left or right.

## Search:

- Array: takes constant time O(1) for searching/access the index
- Linked List: O(n) because you have to traverse the list from start to end to search for the element

## Summary the performace between linked lists and arrays

| Operation        | Linked List | Array |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Access           | O(n)        | O(1)  |
| Insert (at head) | O(1)        | O(n)  |
| Delete (at head) | O(1)        | O(n)  |
| Insert (at tail) | O(n)        | O(n)  |
| Delete (at tail) | O(n)        | O(n)  |
