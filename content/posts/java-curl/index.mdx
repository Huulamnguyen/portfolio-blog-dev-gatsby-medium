# What is curl?

**_curl_** is a command-line tool for transferring data from or to a server. It supports multiple protocols, including HTTP.
In this article, you will learn how to use curl to make requests from the command-line, as well as how to parse the responses to those requests.

For example, say you are building a cryptocurrency trading app. If you built the back-end API first, you could access your exchange rate data before even building a webpage:

```java
$ curl https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/buy

{
  "data": {
    "base": "BTC",
    "currency": "USD",
    "amount": "33006.51"
  }
}
```

# Making GET Requests

The most basic curl command is:

```java
curl http://example.com/abc

```

# Specifying a Request’s HTTP Method Using **_-X_**

By default, **_curl_** makes **_GET_** requests, but you can use the **_-X_** option (short for **_--request_**) followed by the HTTP verb (eg. **_PUT, POST, DELETE_**, etc.) of your choice to make other types of requests.

For example, to make a DELETE request to http://sample-api.com/sample-resource/id, you would run:

```java
curl -X DELETE http://sample-api.com/sample-resource/id
```

OR:

```java
curl --request DELETE http://sample-api.com/sample-resource/id

```

# Adding Data to the Request Body Using **_-d_**

To send data in the body of a request made with **_curl_**, you can use the **_-d_** option (short for **_--data_**) followed by the data you wish to send.
For example, to update the name of the user with **_id=1_**, run:

```java
curl -X PUT -d "username=Lily" http://sample-api.com/users/1

```

Additional key-value pairs can be added with the ampersand **_&_** symbol:

```java
curl -X PUT -d "username=Lily&height=180" http://sample-api.com/users/1

```

Note that if you include the **_-d_** option and do not specify an HTTP verb, **_curl_** will default to sending a **_POST_** request. That means that

```java
curl -X POST -d "username=Lily" http://sample-api.com/users
```

AND:

```java
curl -d "username=Lily" http://sample-api.com/users

```

are equivalent.

# Setting the Request’s Content Type Using **_-H_**

By default, **_curl_** sends **_POST/PUT_** requests with the content-type **_application/x-www-form-urlencoded_**.
If you are using **_curl_** to make a request to an API that expects to receive data in JSON format, you must set the request’s content-type to **_application/json_** by adding a request heade

Use the **_-H_** (short for **_--header_**) option, followed by the header you wish to add to your request, to specify the request’s content-type like so:

```java
curl -d "{ \"username\": \"Lily\" }" -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://sample-api.com/users
```

# Parsing Server Responses Using **_-i_**

Adding the **_-i_** option (short for **_--include_**) to your **_curl_** commands will cause **_curl_** to print the response header to the command shell in addition to the response body.

```java
$ curl -i https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/buy

HTTP/2 200
date: ...
content-type: ...
...
```

Some of the client errors you are most likely to encounter include

- **_401_**, which indicates that the client is not authenticated and therefore not allowed to access the specified resource
- **_403_**, which indicates that the client is authenticated but not permitted to view the specified resource
- **_404_**, which indicates that the specified resource cannot be found on the server
