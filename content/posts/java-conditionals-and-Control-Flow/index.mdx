# else Statement

The **_else_** statement executes a block of code when the condition inside the **_if_** statement is **_false_**. The **_else_** statement is always the last condition.

```java
boolean condition1 = false;

if (condition1){
    System.out.println("condition1 is true");
}
else{
    System.out.println("condition1 is not true");
}
// Prints: condition1 is not true
```

## else if Statements

**_else-if_** statements can be chained together to check multiple conditions. Once a condition is **_true_**, a code block will be executed and the conditional statement will be exited.

There can be multiple **_else-if_** statements in a single conditional statement.

```java
int testScore = 76;
char grade;

if (testScore >= 90) {
  grade = 'A';
} else if (testScore >= 80) {
  grade = 'B';
} else if (testScore >= 70) {
  grade = 'C';
} else if (testScore >= 60) {
  grade = 'D';
} else {
  grade = 'F';
}

System.out.println("Grade: " + grade); // Prints: C
```

# if Statement

An **_if_** statement executes a block of code when a specified boolean expression is evaluated as **_true_**.

```java
if (true) {
	System.out.println("This code executes");
}
// Prints: This code executes

if (false) {
	System.out.println("This code does not execute");
}
// There is no output for the above statement
```

# Java Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)

There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands.

Instead of writing:

```java
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
  System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
  System.out.println("Good evening.");
}
```

You can simply write:

```java
int time = 20;
String result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";
System.out.println(result);
```

# Nested Conditional Statements

A nested conditional statement is a conditional statement nested inside of another conditional statement.
The outer conditional statement is evaluated first; if the condition is **_true_**, then the nested conditional statement will be evaluated.

```java
boolean studied = true;
boolean wellRested = true;

if (wellRested) {
  System.out.println("Best of luck today!");
  if (studied) {
    System.out.println("You are prepared for your exam!");
  } else {
    System.out.println("Study before your exam!");
  }
}

// Prints: Best of luck today!
// Prints: You are prepared for your exam!
```

# Java Switch Statement

Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.

This is how it works:

- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter

The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

```java
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Sunday");
    break;
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
```

# The **_break_** Keyword

When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.

# The **_default_** Keyword

The **_default_** keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match:

```java
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Today is Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Today is Sunday");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Looking forward to the Weekend");
}
// Outputs "Looking forward to the Weekend"
```

# AND Operator

The AND logical operator is represented by **_&&_**. This operator returns **_true_** if the **_boolean_** expressions on both sides of the operator are **_true_**; otherwise, it returns **_false_**.

```java
System.out.println(true && true); // Prints: true
System.out.println(true && false); // Prints: false
System.out.println(false && true); // Prints: false
System.out.println(false && false); // Prints: false
```

# NOT Operator

The NOT logical operator is represented by **_!_**. This operator negates the value of a boolean expression.

```java
boolean a = true;
System.out.println(!a); // Prints: false

System.out.println(!false) // Prints: true
```

# The OR Operator

The logical **_OR_** operator is represented by **_||_**.
This operator will return **_true_** if at least one of the **_boolean_** expressions being compared has a **_true_** value; otherwise, it will return **_false_**.

```java
System.out.println(true || true); // Prints: true
System.out.println(true || false); // Prints: true
System.out.println(false || true); // Prints: true
System.out.println(false || false); // Prints: false
```

# Conditional Operators - Order of Evaluation

If an expression contains multiple conditional operators, the order of evaluation is as follows: **_Expressions in parentheses -> NOT -> AND -> OR_**.

```java
boolean foo = true && (!false || true); // true
/*
(!false || true) is evaluated first because it is contained within parentheses.

Then !false is evaluated as true because it uses the NOT operator.

Next, (true || true) is evaluation as true.

Finally, true && true is evaluated as true meaning foo is true. */
```
