# else Statement

The **_else_** statement executes a block of code when the condition inside the **_if_** statement is **_false_**. The **_else_** statement is always the last condition.

```java
boolean condition1 = false;

if (condition1){
    System.out.println("condition1 is true");
}
else{
    System.out.println("condition1 is not true");
}
// Prints: condition1 is not true
```
