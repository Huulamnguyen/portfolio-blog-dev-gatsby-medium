# Index

An index refers to an elementâ€™s position within an array.

The index of an array starts from 0 and goes up to one less than the total length of the array.

```java
int[] marks = {50, 55, 60, 70, 80};

System.out.println(marks[0]);
// Output: 50

System.out.println(marks[4]);
// Output: 80
```

# Arrays

In Java, an array is used to store a list of elements of the same datatype.

Arrays are fixed in size and their elements are ordered.

```java
// Create an array of 5 int elements
int[] marks = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

# Array creation in Java

In Java, an array can be created in the following ways:

- Using the {} notation, by adding each element all at once.
- Using the new keyword, and assigning each position of the array individually.

```java
int[] age = {20, 21, 30};

int[] marks = new int[3];
marks[0] = 50;
marks[1] = 70;
marks[2] = 93;
```

# Changing an Element Value

To change an element value, select the element via its index and use the assignment operator to set a new value.

```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 0, 4};
// Change value at index 2
nums[2] = 3;
```

# Java ArrayList

In Java, an ArrayList is used to represent a dynamic list.

While Java arrays are fixed in size (the size cannot be modified), an ArrayList allows flexibility by being able to both add and remove elements.

```java
// import the ArrayList package
import java.util.ArrayList;

// create an ArrayList called students
ArrayList<String> students = new ArrayList<String>();
```

# Modifying ArrayLists in Java

An ArrayList can easily be modified using built in methods.

To add elements to an ArrayList, you use the **_add()_** method. The element that you want to add goes inside of the ().

To remove elements from an ArrayList, you use the **_remove()_** method. Inside the () you can specify the index of the element that you want to remove. Alternatively, you can specify directly the element that you want to remove.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Students {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

     // create an ArrayList called studentList, which initially holds []
		ArrayList<String> studentList = new ArrayList<String>();

    // add students to the ArrayList
    studentList.add("John");
    studentList.add("Lily");
    studentList.add("Samantha");
    studentList.add("Tony");

    // remove John from the ArrayList, then Lily
    studentList.remove(0);
    studentList.remove("Lily");

    // studentList now holds [Samantha, Tony]

    System.out.println(studentList);
  }
}
```
