# What is Singly Linked List?

- A **singly linked** list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory
  locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer.

# Singly Linked List Implementation

## Constructor

1. Create a **Node** class with the following features

   a. A constructor that takes a **value** as an argument and initializes the value attribute of the node.

   b. A **next** attribute, initialized to **None**, which will store a reference to the next node in the list.

2. Create a **LinkedList** class with the following features:

   a. A constructor that takes a value as an argument, creates a new **Node** with that value, and initializes the **head** and **tail** attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.

   b. A **length** attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = None


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
        self.length = 1

    def print_list(self):
        temp = self.head
        while temp is not None:
            print(temp)
            temp = temp.next

    def make_empty(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.length = 0
```

## Append

- Implement the **append** method for the LinkedList class.
  The **append** method should add a new node with a given value to the end of the linked list,
  updating the tail attribute and the length attribute accordingly.

- **Big O: O(1)**

  - No matter how large the linked list is, the number of operations taken to execute append remains **constant**

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def append(self, value):
  # Create a new node with the given value
  new_node = Node(value)

  # Check to see if the linked list is empty
  if self.head is None:
    # Point both head and tail at the new node
    self.head = new_node
    self.tail = new_node
  else:
    # Point the next pointer of the last node at the new node
    self.tail.next = new_node
    # Point tail at the new node
    self.tail = new_node

  # Increment the length of the linked list
  self.length += 1
```

## Pop

- The **pop** method should remove the last node (tail) from the linked list and return the removed node.
  If the list is empty, the method should return None.

- After the last node is removed, the second-to-last node should become the new tail of the list.

- **Big O: O(n)**

  - Iterate over the linked list until reach the tail.
  - Update the tail

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def pop(self):
  # Check if the list is empty
  if self.length == 0:
    return None
  # Initialize temp and pre to the head
  temp = self.head
  pre = self.head
  # Iterate until the last node
  while(temp.next):
    pre = temp
    temp = temp.next
  # Set the new tail to the previous node
  self.tail = pre
  # Remove link to the removed node
  self.tail.next = None
  # Decrement list length by 1
  self.length -= 1
  # Check if the list is now empty
  if self.length == 0:
    # Set head and tail to None
    self.head = None
    self.tail = None
  # Return the removed node
  return temp
```

## Prepend

- The **prepend** method should add a new node with a given value to the
  beginning of the linked list, updating the head attribute and the length attribute accordingly.

- **Big O: O(1)**

  - Constant time
  - Just need to add and update the head attribute

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def prepend(self, value):
  # Create a new Node with the given value
  new_node = Node(value)

  # Check if the linked list is empty
  if self.length == 0:
    # Set the head and tail attributes to the new node
    self.head = new_node
    self.tail = new_node
  else:
    # Set the next attribute of the new node to the current head
    new_node.next = self.head
    # Update the head attribute to the new node
    self.head = new_node

  # Increment the length attribute of the LinkedList
  self.length += 1

  # Return True to indicate a successful operation
  return True
```

## Pop First

- The **pop_first** method should remove the first node (the head) from the linked list,
  update the head attribute and the length attribute accordingly, and return the removed node.

- **Big O: O(1)**

  - Constant time
  - Remove the first node (the head) from the linked list
  - Update the head attribute and the length attribute

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def pop_first(self):
  # Check if the list is empty
  if self.length == 0:
    return None

  # Save a reference to the current head node
  temp = self.head

  # Update the head to the second node in the list
  self.head = self.head.next

  # Disconnect the removed node from the list
  temp.next = None

  # Decrease the length of the list by 1
  self.length -= 1

  # Check if the list is now empty
  if self.length == 0:
    # Set the tail to None if the list is empty
    self.tail = None

  # Return the removed node
  return temp
```

## Get

- The **get** method should take an integer index as a parameter and return a pointer to the node at the specified index in the linked list.

- **Big O: O(n)**

  - Iterate through the list until the specified index is

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def get(self, index):
    # Check if the given index is out of bounds
    if index < 0 or index >= self.length:
        return None

    # Initialize a temporary variable to the head of the list
    temp = self.head

    # Traverse the list 'index' times
    for _ in range(index):
        # Move the temporary variable to the next node in the list
        temp = temp.next

    # Return the node at the specified index
    return temp

```

## Set

- The **set_value** method should take an integer index and a value as parameters and
  update the value of the node at the specified index in the linked list.

- **Big O: O(n)**

  - **set_value** uses the **get** method, which is O(n), to iterate through the linked list

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def set_value(self, index, value):
    # Call the 'get' method to find the node at the specified index
    temp = self.get(index)

    # Check if a valid node was found at the specified index
    if temp:
        # Update the value of the found node with the given value
        temp.value = value

        # Return True to indicate that the value was updated successfully
        return True

    # If no valid node was found, return False to indicate that
    # the value was not updated
    return False
```

## Insert

- The **insert** method should take an integer index and a value as parameters and
  insert a new node with the given value at the specified index in the linked list.

- **Big O: O(n)**

  - **insert** uses the **get** method, which is O(n), to iterate through the linked list

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def insert(self, index, value):
    # Check if index is out of bounds
    if index < 0 or index > self.length:
        return False
    # If index is 0, prepend the value
    if index == 0:
        return self.prepend(value)
    # If index is at the end, append the value
    if index == self.length:
        return self.append(value)
    # Create a new node with the value
    new_node = Node(value)
    # Get the node just before the insertion point
    temp = self.get(index - 1)
    # Set new_node's next to temp's next
    new_node.next = temp.next
    # Update temp's next to the new_node
    temp.next = new_node
    # Increment the length of the list
    self.length += 1
    # Return True as node inserted successfully
    return True
```

## Remove

- The **remove** method should take an integer index as a parameter and
  remove the node at the specified index in the linked list, returning the removed node.

- **Big O: O(n)**

  - **remove** uses the **get** method, which is O(n), to iterate through the linked list

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def remove(self, index):
    # Check if index is out of bounds
    if index < 0 or index >= self.length:
        return None
    # Remove and return the first node
    if index == 0:
        return self.pop_first()
    # Remove and return the last node
    if index == self.length - 1:
        return self.pop()
    # Get the previous node
    pre = self.get(index - 1)
    # Set temp to the node to be removed
    temp = pre.next
    # Update pre.next to skip the removed node
    pre.next = temp.next
    # Disconnect the removed node
    temp.next = None
    # Decrement the list length
    self.length -= 1
    # Return the removed node
    return temp
```

## Reverse

- The reverse method should reverse the order of the nodes in the linked list so that the head becomes the tail and the tail becomes the head.

- **Big O: O(n)**

  - Iterate through the linked list to swap each node

- Implementation:
  - Please note: the method should be inside the LinkedList class.

```python
def reverse(self):
    # Swap the head and tail pointers
    temp = self.head
    self.head = self.tail
    self.tail = temp

    # Initialize variables for the next and previous nodes
    after = temp.next
    before = None

    # Iterate through the list to reverse the next pointers
    for _ in range(self.length):
        # Store the next node in the list
        after = temp.next

        # Update the current node's next pointer to the previous node
        temp.next = before

        # Move the previous node to the current node
        before = temp

        # Move the current node to the next node in the list
        temp = after
```

This is the end of Singly LinkedList Implementation
