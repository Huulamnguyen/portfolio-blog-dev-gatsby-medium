# What is Singly Linked List?

- A **singly linked** list is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored in contiguous memory
  locations and each element is connected only to its next element using a pointer.

# Singly Linked List Implementation

## Constructor

1. Create a **Node** class with the following features

   a. A constructor that takes a **value** as an argument and initializes the value attribute of the node.

   b. A **next** attribute, initialized to **None**, which will store a reference to the next node in the list.

2. Create a **LinkedList** class with the following features:

   a. A constructor that takes a value as an argument, creates a new **Node** with that value, and initializes the **head** and **tail** attributes of the linked list to point to the new node.

   b. A **length** attribute, initialized to 1, which represents the current number of nodes in the list.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = None


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self, value):
        new_node = Node(value)
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
        self.length = 1

    def print_list(self):
        temp = self.head
        while temp is not None:
            print(temp)
            temp = temp.next

    def make_empty(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
        self.length = 0
```

## Append

- Implement the **append** method for the LinkedList class.
  The **append** method should add a new node with a given value to the end of the linked list, updating the tail attribute and the length attribute accordingly.

```python
class Node
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

class LinkedList:
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

  def append(self, value):
    # Create a new node with the given value
    new_node = Node(value)

    # Check to see if the linked list is empty
    if self.head is None:
        # Point both head and tail at the new node
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
    else:
        # Point the next pointer of the last node at the new node
        self.tail.next = new_node
        # Point tail at the new node
        self.tail = new_node

    # Increment the length of the linked list
    self.length += 1
```

## Pop

- The **pop** method should remove the last node (tail) from the linked list and return the removed node. If the list is empty, the method should return None.

- After the last node is removed, the second-to-last node should become the new tail of the list.

```python
class Node
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

class LinkedList:
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

  def append(self, value):
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

  def pop(self):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if self.length == 0:
        return None
    # Initialize temp and pre to the head
    temp = self.head
    pre = self.head
    # Iterate until the last node
    while(temp.next):
        pre = temp
        temp = temp.next
    # Set the new tail to the previous node
    self.tail = pre
    # Remove link to the removed node
    self.tail.next = None
    # Decrement list length by 1
    self.length -= 1
    # Check if the list is now empty
    if self.length == 0:
        # Set head and tail to None
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
    # Return the removed node
    return temp
```

## Prepend

- The **prepend** method should add a new node with a given value to the beginning of the linked list, updating the head attribute and the length attribute accordingly.

```python
class Node
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

class LinkedList:
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

  def append(self, value):
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

  def pop(self):
  ### pre-written code ###
  ### ... ###

  def prepend(self, value):
    # Create a new Node with the given value
    new_node = Node(value)

    # Check if the linked list is empty
    if self.length == 0:
      # Set the head and tail attributes to the new node
      self.head = new_node
      self.tail = new_node
    else:
      # Set the next attribute of the new node to the current head
      new_node.next = self.head
      # Update the head attribute to the new node
      self.head = new_node

    # Increment the length attribute of the LinkedList
    self.length += 1

    # Return True to indicate a successful operation
    return True
```
